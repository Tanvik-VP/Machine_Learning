    "A* search is a type of algorithm used to find the shortest path between two points in a graph or a map. It is a variation of the popular Dijkstra's algorithm, but it also takes into account an estimate of the remaining distance to the target point, also known as the heuristic.\n",
    "A* search starts at the initial point and explores all possible paths to the target point. For each path, it calculates the cost of moving from the current point to the next point and the estimated remaining distance to the target point (using the heuristic). The algorithm then chooses the path with the lowest total cost, which is the sum of the cost of moving and the estimated remaining distance. The algorithm continues this process until it reaches the target point."
